WFS TODO / ideas (no particular order)

- add TriggerSpec and use in various Udefs
- infinite events: keep fade out time at stop
- subwoofers
- add Envelope spec / gui / udef (fixed/max number of points?)
- Folder events / sub-scores:
	- implement cutting sub-scores
	- inner score looping.
- MultiUdef: being able to select defs by index instead of defName
	- HiddenUdef is then obsolete; it can simply use Udefs with addToAll:false
- WFSServers: better gui
	- button for loading al udefs
	- working buttons for server management (now that the ssh problem is fixed)
	- panic button (stop all - not kill)
	- loaded buffers / synths indicator
- WFSPath
	- implement free spline wfspaths
	- rename to WFSPath; subclass of Trajectory
	- more generators:
		- import SVG
		- import MIDI
		- more basic shapes
	- export SVG
	- export MIDI?
	- WFSMultiPath: timeline display and better support
	- save/read from WFSPathGUI
	- unified save/read system (Buffer:write vs. SoundFile)
	- add trigger option to wfsPathPlayer Udef
- more elaborate osc / midi support (discuss with Miguel)
	- ability to "tag" parameters and assign specific osc/midi commands to them
	- should be saved with USession
		- how to assign to specific objects? Via index? Via dependant-like system? Both?
	- clean way of setting intelligent args (points, bufsndfiles, eqs etc)
	- full gui
	- midi specs / guis (also useful for WFSPathGenerators)
- gui for RichBufferSpec
- save WFSPathTransformDefs / -GeneratorDefs in separate files (UnitDef style)
- UMixer for session
- MassEdit:
	- more options for wfspath massedit
	- option for expanding group of units into new window
	- MassUChain editor should allow to edit multiple paths, at least to be able to plot them.
- core:
	- allow change of units in chain during playback
	- clear all option (in case buffers or synths are kept by mistake)
	- handle buffer-not-found correctly (i.e. give user option to cancel playback)
		- may require a do-on-failed action/method
	- fix release problem for non-releaseself events
- more documentation
	
- future ideas
	- implement score position jumping during playback, without stopping the score (similar to pause)
	- midi import
	- mass generators for events
	- pattern support for UChains built-in
	- alternative timeline with tempo/meter
		- all time setting gui's should be switcheable (or it could be a preference setting)
		- option for midi import of timeline/meter settings
	- multichannel unit (composed of an array of single-channel units)
	- option to show waveforms in path editor 
		- possibly as width of the trajectory line
	- redirect args (extra args pointing to others via a function)
		- standard sets for example for \freq and \amp
	- clipboard (copy/paste) for WFSPathGUI
	- dedicated generic Udef class for WFS (and other) panners
		- including the multisynth/group/pause structure and redirecting of args to correct synth
	- language-based automation
	- Right-click menu
