WFS TODO NEW (no particular order)

- infinite events: keep fade out time at stop
- subwoofers
- make plane waves plot as plane waves
- UEQ: preset system (perhaps a generic one for other objects too)
- WFSSpeakerConf: editor
- configuration files: overhaul/simplify
- add preference pane (mainly for offline version)
- different default UChain for WFS lib
- single window for Udefs/UnitRacks (shoud we rename UnitRack to URack?)
- update Udefs window when Udef is added or changed
	- or make sure otherwise that the correct udef is dragged
- implement NamedListSpec (being able to assign different labels to elements/values)
- add envelope spec / gui / udef (fixed/max number of points?)
- MultiUdef: being able to select defs by index instead of defName
	- HiddenUdef is then obsolete; it can simply use Udefs with addToAll:false
	- addToAll should be propagated to all Udef subclasses
- implement ArgSpec:mode
	- make it work
	- define specific default modes for specific arg names (amp: \normal, freq: \synced)
- WFSServers: better gui
	- button for loading al udefs
	- working buttons for server management (now that the ssh problem is fixed)
	- panic button (stop all - not kill)
	- loaded buffers / synths indicator
- implement Convolution (with a subclass of RichBuffer/BufSndFile)
- WFSPath
	- implement free spline wfspaths
	- rename to WFSPath; subclass of Trajectory
	X check undo functionality (seems broken) FIXED
	- more generators:
		- import SVG
		- import MIDI
		- more basic shapes
	- export SVG
	- export MIDI?
	- WFSMultiPath: timeline display and better support
	- save/read from WFSPathGUI
	- unified save/read system (Buffer:write vs. SoundFile)
	- lock times/positions in editor
	- enable elastic editing in timeline
	- add trigger option to wfsPathPlayer Udef
- more elaborate osc / midi support (discuss with Miguel)
	- ability to "tag" parameters and assign specific osc/midi commands to them
	- should be saved with USession
		- how to assign to specific objects? Via index? Via dependant-like system? Both?
	- clean way of setting intelligent args (points, bufsndfiles, eqs etc)
	- full gui
	- midi specs / guis (also useful for WFSPathGenerators)
- gui for RichBufferSpec
- intelligent RandID handling (hidden arg)
- save WFSPathTransformDefs / -GeneratorDefs in separate files (UnitDef style)
- MassEdit:
	- more options for wfspath massedit
	- option for expanding group of units into new window
	- drag / drop replacement of units
- core:
	- allow change of units in chain during playback
	- clear all option (in case buffers or synths are kept by mistake)
	- handle buffer-not-found correctly (i.e. give user option to cancel playback)
		- may require a do-on-failed action/method
	- fix release problem for non-releaseself events
	
- future ideas
	- implement score position jumping during playback
	- meta/marker events
		- events that are able to start/stop/pause/jump in a score
		- key command for jumping to marker
		- make sure it supports "cuelist" style playback
	- midi import
	- mass generators for events
	- pattern support for UChains (if possible)
	- alternative timeline with tempo/meter
		- all time setting gui's should be switcheable (or it could be a preference setting)
		- option for midi import of timeline/meter settings
	- multichannel unit (composed of an array of single-channel units)
	- intelligent mixed plot/animate for all wfs positions and trajectories
	- option to show waveforms in path editor 
		- possibly as width of the trajectory line
	- redirect args (extra args pointing to others via a function)
		- standard sets for example for \freq and \amp
	- clipboard (copy/paste) for WFSPathGUI and UScoreGUI
	- dedicated generic Udef class for WFS (and other) panners
		- including the multisynth/group/pause structure and redirecting of args to correct synth
	- language-based automation
