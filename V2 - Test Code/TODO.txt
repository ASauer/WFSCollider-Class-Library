For Beta 2 - to be released in December before workshop ?

Bugs:
 - Stuff not releasing correctly. pointing to empty array, should be nil.
 - Multiple panners, where some only play on one server, sometimes don't free the chain on one server. This also affects Load balancing.

TODO:
 - Mass editor - set infinite for all
 - Settable time for how long to do
 - MassUChain editor should allow to edit multiple paths, at least to be able to plot them. -W
 - Move Unit stuff into a Quark, import the quark into WFSCollider (change cmake file).
 - USessionGUI, UChainGroup, USessionList - make it more functional. Drag and Drop.
 - Code editing - perhaps for now only of file Udefs.
 - update cmake. - wait for Quark situation.
 - Cut events - u_trimStart, u_trimEnd.
 - take elements from USession into score.
 - Reorder elements in USession
 - UMixer for session
 - Move WFSPath stuff into UTrajectory, etc. I really think we should do this, this is a great class, and it can be used by people using ambisonics and VBAP. It could easilly become the standard trajectory stuff for supercollider.
 - Cleanup: remove unused files. Check if there are unused methods. Check if there is code that can (easilly) be made more elegant.
 - Documentation: schelp files for classes.
 - MassEdit - add and remove units.
 - supernova.
 - inner score looping.
 - nested chains/ UChain groups
 - Right-click menu
 - drag and drop
 - implement cutting sub-scores
 - cleanup code.
 - UDef code editing - allow forking code to new Udef.
 - remove MetaUdef -M, W?
 - invent fixed extension names for Trajectory, and perhaps also for UEvent files.
 - add more Udefs -M,W
 - cpu wfsservers view

Done:
 X - offline panners.
